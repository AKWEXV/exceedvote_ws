exceedvote_ws
=============

ExceedVote v.2 is a web application using Play! Framework that enables voting or judging of contestants in a competition. It is based on [KKPS's ExceedVote](https://github.com/KKPS/exceedvote) that was written for Kasetsart's Software Spec & Design course, and used in the 2012 Exceed Camp.

ExceedVote v.2 has both selection-voting (choose one, like voting in an election) and score-based voting (assign each contestant a score of 1-10 on a criterion), and a RESTful web service interface.
